Due next Friday (Feb. 14) Valentine's Day <3

Many edge cases and counter cases - read spec! Quiz on Canvas for the spec

Unix shell
> ps		// Am I using a shell?
> smash		// Launch our shell

Top of file: #1/bin/sh		// Done under a shell

Bash/Batch mode: A file with listed commands, executed one after the other

Shell:
- Shows you a prompt: (smash) in front of entry
- Like a loop - prompts for user input every time
- Enter string "exit" to stop the while loop
- You can still run other programs under the shell (grep, etc.): The shell is invoking these programs
- Command 'which' - find where a particular command is defined
	which ls ----> /bin/ls

Read and parse what is entered to decide what to put in smash file.

Functionality:
- Specify search path
- Add search path: > path [add/remove/clear]
- exit capability
- cd function - change directory


* Strsep does not work on constant strings
	- Takes in pointer
	- Returns the position of ..
	- Prints one token at a time
	- Printed empty spaces: if you don't care, make a condition if(strlen <= 0);

Shivaram notes:

What happens when we run ls
	1. Find out where the binary is that i need to run ls?
		The binary in /bin/ls
		PATH or search path
	2. Now we need to RUN it!
		Create a new process that will run ls
		fork: create a child process
	3. We want the new process to run ls
		exec
	4. How do I handle or figure out the options to execv
		Parse the line that you read and tokenize


Redirection:
- ls > /tmp/psout
- dup2: changes the file descriptor
