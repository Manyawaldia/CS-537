Discussion 02/25/2020

- All projects are 10 day chunks
- XV6 project on memory management

- 2 projects, 2 submissions
- Due March 5
- A little bit more work than P2B - but not double the amount of work
- Spec quiz on canvas
- SLIP days: blank slate - the group has 2 late days :( NOT ENOUGH

Objectives:
    1. Adding memory protections to pages using protection bits
    2. Physical page allocation (given any virtual addr - place anywhere in mem)
        - 2 new impl. for page allocators

How does an address space look in xv6?


walkpgdir - walks through page directory, iterates, return physical page table entry
line 94 - most important line for project:
    *pte = pa | perm | PTE_P;
    - We are filling in the PTE with pa bitwiseOR permission | present_bit


lcr3 in xv6 - don't worry about how it works
    - Move val into CR3 reg
